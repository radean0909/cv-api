# Curriculum Vitae
An express/react driven app to build resume's / CV's and demonstrate in an fun-way my full-stack coding abilities!

## Set-up
The easiest way to use this code is to fork the repo and link it to a heroku instance. However, doing so will require setting some environment variables and having a mongo instance that can be connected to.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository locally and ensure that you have a mongo DB running on the localhost (or elsewhere, if the appropriate environment variables are set (see ./src/app/boot/config.js).

Then you can simple run: 
```npm start```

## Test
```npm test```
